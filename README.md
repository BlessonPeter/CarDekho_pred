# Car Price Prediction

Predicting car prices using machine learning model trained on data from the CarDekho website dataset.

Overview
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices based on various features . The model were trained using a dataset scraped from the CarDekho website, which contains detailed information about different car listings.

Features
Data Collection:  
The dataset used for training the models was collected by scraping car listings from the CarDekho website. We gathered information such as car specifications, mileage, fuel type, year of manufacture, etc.
Data Preprocessing: 
The collected data underwent extensive preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and more. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training machine learning models.
Model Training: 
Several machine learning models were trained on the preprocessed data to predict car prices. We experimented with various algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to find the best-performing model.
Evaluation: 
The trained models were evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess their performance and generalization ability. We used techniques such as cross-validation to ensure reliable estimates of model performance.
Usage
Data Collection: 
The data_collection directory contains scripts for scraping car listings from the CarDekho website. You can run these scripts to collect your own dataset if needed.
Data Preprocessing: The data_preprocessing directory contains scripts for preprocessing the collected data. These scripts handle tasks such as cleaning, encoding, and scaling the features.
Model Training:
The model_training directory contains scripts for training machine learning models on the preprocessed data. You can experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best model for your use case.
Evaluation: 
The evaluation directory contains scripts for evaluating the performance of trained models using various metrics and techniques. You can use these scripts to assess the quality of your models and make improvements as needed.

Requirements
Python 3
Scikit-learn
